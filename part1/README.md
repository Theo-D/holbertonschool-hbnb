### :open_file_folder: High-Level Package Diagram

The system follows a layered architecture, ensuring separation of concerns and maintainability. Below is a high-level package diagram illustrating said structure:

![High-Level Architecture Diagram](diagrams/PackageDiagram.drawio.png)

#### The package diagram features the following:

### :bricks: A Layered Architecture

- **Presentation Layer**: Handles user interactions through user interface and API calls.
- **Business Logic Layer**: Contains an abstraction of the business rules and logic.
- **Data Access Layer**: Manages persistence and data operations.

### :performing_arts: A Facade Pattern

- **Facade** is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other complex set of classes.

## 🧠 Business Logic Layer

### 🧬 Class Diagram

The core business logic is abstracted through classes and objects as is the aim of object-oriented principles. The class diagram below illustrates the main entities and their relationships:

```mermaid
classDiagram
direction LR
    class User {
	    - int id
	    - datetime dateCreation
	    - datettime dateUpdate
	    - bool isAdmin
	    - UserIdentity uId
	    + makeBooking(booking)
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }
    class Host {
	    - int rating
	    + getPlaces()
	    + editPlace()
    }
    class UserIdentity {
	    - string firstName
	    - string lastName
	    - String dateOfBirth
	    - string address
	    - string phoneNumber
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }
    class Place {
	    - int Id
	    - string name
	    - string address
	    - string description
	    - int rating
	    - int capacity
	    - int pricePerNight
	    - List amenities
	    + addAmenity(amenity)
	    + getAvailability()
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }
    class Review {
	    - int id
	    - int rating
	    - string comment
	    - datetime date
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }
    class Booking {
	    - int id
	    - int guestCount
	    - int totalPrice
	    - string status
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }
    class Amenity {
	    - int id
	    - string name
	    - string description
	    - string icon
	    + get()
	    + set()
    }

    User <|-- Host
    UserIdentity --* User
    Host "1" --> "1.." Place : owns
    User "1" --> "0.." Review : leaves
    User "1" --> "0.." Booking : makes
    Review "0..1" --> "1" Booking : concerns
    Place "1" <--> "0.." Booking
    Place o-- "0.." Amenity : features
```

### :mag: Entities Overview

---

- **User and UserIdentity**: Is used to describe an user of the service with attributes fitting its role. It is the entity around which the service revolves.
- **Host**: Herited from the User class, his particularity is to offer a service in the form of one or more places to rent.
- **Place**: It is the service provided by hosts. A host must owns at least one place, but can also own several.
- **Review**: This entity translates the quality of the service as experienced by the user.
- **Booking**: Is used to keep track of the availability of places as well as the number of guests, the duration of the stay or the price total of the service provided.
- **Amenity**: This entity is a surplus service provided by the host. It is not mandatory, but it greatly appreciates the value of a place.

These components work together to provide a well defined abstraction of the business workings.

### Translating Classes relationship to code

---

Relations between entities are not mere cosmetic, they serve to describe reality and, as such, help build a reliable code that translates to a real-life service.

The most important relations featured in this class diagram are *** Composition *** and *** Aggregation ***.

What follows are code snippets that aim to illustrate how composition and aggregation work in Python:

Here, Amenity is aggregated to Place; Amenity is used as an attribute of the class Place, but is not mandatory for it to work.
```python
class Amenity:
    def __init__(self, id : int, name : str, description : str):
        self.__id = id
        self.__name = name
        self.__description = description

    def __str__(self):
        return self.__name

class Place:
    def __init__(self, id : int, name : str, address : str, description : str):
        self.__id = id
        self.__name = name
        self.__address = address
        self.__description = description
        self.__amenities =  []

    def __str__(self):
        strList = ', '.join(str(amenity) for amenity in self.__amenities)
        format = "Nom du lieu: {}\n" \
        "Adresse: {}\n" \
        "Description: {}\n" \
        "Commodités: {}\n".format(self.__name, self.__address, self.__description, strList)
        return format

    def add_amenities(self, amenity):
        self.__amenities.append(amenity)
```
Then, composition; the instance of the class UserIdentity by being a parameter of the object constructor of the User class is an integral part
of the User class. An instance of the User class cannot existed if it is not composed of an instance of the UserIdentity class.

```python
class UserIdentity:
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, address, phoneNumber):
        self.__firstName = firstName
        self.__lastName = lastName
        self.__address = address
        self.__dateOfBirth = dateOfBirth
        self.__phoneNumber = phoneNumber

    def __str__(self):
        format = "L'utilisateur {} {} est né le {} à {}".format(
            self.__firstName,
            self.__lastName,
            self.__dateOfBirth,
            self.__address)
        return format

class User:
    def __init__(self, id, dateCreation, dateUpdate, isAdmin, userIdentity):
        self.__id = id
        self.__dateCreation = dateCreation
        self.__dateUpdate = dateUpdate
        self.__isAdmin = isAdmin
        self.__userIdentity = userIdentity

    def __str__(self):
        return str(self.__userIdentity)
```

Eventually, in the main.py file:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
from classesAgreg import Amenity, Place
from classesComp import UserIdentity, User

if __name__ == '__main__':

    place1 = Place(1, "Siège du PCF", "2, place du Colonel-Fabien", "Un bâtiment avant-gardiste")

    userId = UserIdentity("Thierry", "Martin", "22 avril 1970", "Clermont-Ferrand", "+33 6 75 58 12 12")
    user1 = User(1, "06/06/2025", "06/06/2025", True, userId)

    amenity1 = Amenity(1, "micro onde", "ne pas y sécher le chien")
    amenity2 = Amenity(2, "sèche cheveux", "peut servir à sécher le chien")
    amenity3 = Amenity(3, "wifi", "code wifi: Octore1917")

    place1.add_amenities(amenity1)
    place1.add_amenities(amenity2)
    place1.add_amenities(amenity3)

    print(place1, end="")

    print("_" * 50)
    print()

    print(user1)
```

Which gives us the following output:

```
theo@PC:~/holbertonschool-hbnb/part1$ ./main.py
Nom du lieu: Siège du PCF
Adresse: 2, place du Colonel-Fabien
Description: Un bâtiment avant-gardiste
Commodités: micro onde, sèche cheveux, wifi

## 🔁 API Interaction Flow

### 📊 Sequence Diagrams

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the flow of API calls, demonstrating interactions between components:

#### 🔍 Use case 1: `POST /users/register`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Client
  participant API as API
  participant User as User
  participant UserIdentity as UserIdentity
  participant UserDB as UserDB

  Client ->> API: POST /users/register
  Note right of API: name, address, phone, etc.
  API ->> UserIdentity: create identity
  UserIdentity ->> UserDB: INSERT identity
  UserDB -->> UserIdentity: identity saved
  API ->> User: create user with identity
  User ->> UserDB: INSERT user
  UserDB -->> User: user saved
  API -->> Client: 201 Created + user ID
```

- **Client** sends request to API Gateway.
- **Controller** delegates to the facade.
- **Facade** interacts with business logic and data layer.
- **Response** returned to the client with the item data.

#### ➕ Use case 2: `POST /places`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Host
    participant API
    participant User
    participant Place
    participant UserDB
    participant PlaceDB

    Host->>API: POST /places
    Note right of API: name, address, price, etc.
    API->>User: verify host role
    User->>UserDB: SELECT user
    UserDB-->>User: user info

    API->>Place: create place
    Place->>PlaceDB: INSERT place
    PlaceDB-->>Place: success

    API-->>Host: 201 Created + place ID
```

- **Client** submits item data.
- **Validation** and **transformation** handled in the logic layer.
- **Database** updated, and confirmation returned.

#### ➕ Use case 3: `POST /reviews`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant API
    participant Booking
    participant Review
    participant BookingDB
    participant ReviewDB

    Client->>API: POST /reviews
    Note right of API: booking ID, rating, comment

    API->>BookingDB: SELECT booking
    BookingDB-->>API: booking data

    API->>Review: create review
    Review->>ReviewDB: INSERT review
    ReviewDB-->>Review: success

    API-->>Client: 201 Created
```

- **Client** submits item data.
- **Validation** and **transformation** handled in the logic layer.
- **Database** updated, and confirmation returned.

#### ➕ Use case 4: `GET /places`

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
  participant Client as Client
  participant API as API
  participant Place as Place
  participant PlaceDB as PlaceDB

  Client ->> API: GET /places
  API ->> PlaceDB: SELECT * FROM places WHERE filters_apply
  PlaceDB -->> API: list of matching places
  API -->> Client: 200 OK + places data
```

- **Client** submits item data.
- **Validation** and **transformation** handled in the logic layer.
- **Database** updated, and confirmation returned.
